# üì∞ Fake News Detection using NLP & Machine Learning

![Fake News Detection Banner](FakeNews_Banner.jpeg)

## üìã Problem Statement
In today‚Äôs digital world, we consume news from multiple sources every day ‚Äî social media, online portals, and newspapers.  
However, it‚Äôs often difficult to distinguish between **real** and **fake** news.  
This project aims to build a **machine learning model** that can predict whether a given news headline or article is **real or fake**, based on textual content.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Flow

1. **Problem Understanding**  
   Understand the challenge of fake news detection using text classification techniques.

2. **Data Gathering**  
   Imported the dataset (CSV file) containing labeled news articles (real/fake).

3. **Data Preprocessing**  
   Cleaned and prepared the text for modeling:
   - Tokenization  
   - Converting text to lowercase  
   - Removing stopwords  
   - Lemmatization / Stemming  

4. **Vectorization**  
   Converted text data into numerical form for ML algorithms:  
   - **Bag of Words (CountVectorizer)**  
   - **TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency)**  

5. **Model Building**  
   - Model Initialization (Logistic Regression / Naive Bayes / Random Forest)  
   - Train-Test Split  
   - Model Training and Prediction  

6. **Model Evaluation**  
   Evaluated model performance using:  
   - **Accuracy Score**  
   - **Confusion Matrix**  
   - **Classification Report**

7. **Model Deployment** *(Optional)*  
   - Prepared pipeline for deployment (Flask/Streamlit).  
   - Tested predictions on new unseen news text.
